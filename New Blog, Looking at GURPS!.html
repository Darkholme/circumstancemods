<h2>Preamble</h2>
 <p>First Post!</p>
 <p>I've decided to make a blog, for me to post some gaming stuff, and see where it goes. I just picked up a bunch of GURPS books, and I'm fiddling around with building stuff for my group's first GURPS campaign, which is still quite a ways off (I'm currently on the other side of the continent). I have, however, determined I want to use a bunch of D&amp;D stuff in it (among other things), and while I don't expect I'll convert the entire game's mechanics, I am sure I will convert some of it.</p>
 <p>So, the campaign I'm thinking of, mechanically, is going to be Dungeon Fantasy adjacent. There will be similarities, but I won't be using all of its class templates and the like (though I may use some of it). Character Creation will consist of players cherrypicking a bunch of prebuilt stuff in different categories, and then having a bunch of leftover points to spend freely. For magic I'm thinking I will either use RPM or Incantation, with some tweaks, but using *Powers* to build any spells. I'll be using Powers, to build any special abilities that simply rely on FP or cost nothing to use.</p>
 <p>I also figured converting some special powers will help me familiarize myself with GURPS Powers, which I expect I will make use of a lot.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
 <p>So, it's not a perfectly accurate build of Mage Hand; but it hits all the major points.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Type: Magic - Perfect</li>
  <li>Components: Verbal, Somatic - Perfect</li>
  <li>Range: 30 - Perfect</li>
  <li>Duration: Concentration - No 1 minute maximum, but as it's a cantrip and we can use those at-will anyways, concentration will do the job.</li>
  <li>Lift & Move: It can carry a little more than 10lbs, a little less than 30ft in 6s.
   <ul>
    <li>It's better and more flexible than D&D Mage Hand, as you can lift extra weight at a reduced speed, and there's nothing preventing you from attacking or activating magic items with it, though that attack would not be very good, given the very low ST score it has.</li>
    <li>If you match up the max lift at 10lbs, it's way too slow. If you match up the extra heavy move speed, you can carry ~139lbs while doing so. Looking through my books, there did not seem to be any consistent way to increase the move without also upping the strength. Someone suggested taking Move+1 as a perk, worth 1pt/20% each. That method costs twice as much as this one. The most reasonable price I could find for it was 2%, which made it marginally cheaper than the build above, and significantly less flexible. In the end I settled on the one that didn't involve me inventing new modifiers to make it work.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with how this turned out.</p>
