<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>So, I'm going to go through all the spells (at least the ones in the PHB, we'll see about other sources) and determining which ones are appropriate or inappropriate for a War of the Lions style campaign. Why? Having a blacklist of spells and types of effects will be useful in determining what can be allowed, as well as what to include in homebrew Jobs/Classes/what have you. The overall magic level of FFT is lower than D&D, so stuff is going to get cut. That said, there's also going to be effects and spell types that are widespread and appreciated in FFT that D&D lacks, but that's probably a subject for another post. </p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>So, I somewhat underestimated how long going through all of these spells would take. It's going to take a couple of posts to get through all of these, but that's okay. </p>
<p>A lot of the spells that are a bad fit, are to do with divination and communications. A few also have to do with necessities like food and water. </p>
<p>I suspect the PHB will take another 1-2 posts, and then the other sources will be much quicker. I may do some back and forth in the meantime. It'll make things more interesting if it's not all Jobs all the time until they're finished. </p>
