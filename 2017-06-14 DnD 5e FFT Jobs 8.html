<p>Welcome to Part 8 of Job Builds</p>
<p>Today we're going to take a look at how to do the Dark Knight job for 5e, using Paladin to do so.</p>

<h1>Dark Knight</h1>

<p>Unlike the other art I've used, which all comes from the actual game and its concept art, this one is an excellent piece of fanart made by Kajusx. His <a href="http://kajusx.deviantart.com/">deviantart</a> appears to have been deactivated, but you can find much of his other work on <a href= "https://www.pinterest.com/source/kajusx.deviantart.com">Pinterest, here</a></p>

<p><strong>Premise</strong> — As Established last post, The Dark Knight is a Mageknight (Gish with heavy armor and access to Knightly Weapons) who fights dirty and has a selfish, mercenary, or evil theme.</p>
<p><strong>Core Gameplay Abilities</strong> — Magic, Good Melee Combat, Plate Armor, Knight Weapons, Lifedrain, Mana Drain</p>

<p><strong>Premise</strong> — We reviewed stuff last week, and this week we're going to see how we can make it out of Paladin. I'll reiterate last week's evaluation of Paladin, below.</p>

<h2>Class/Subclass Options</h2>

<p><strong>Paladin</strong> — Good Proficiencies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Divine Sense:</strong> Detect strongly aligned beings and consecrated/desecrated objects/places. Eh. Not terribly useful in an human focused campaign, but its alright. He could detect the few undead and zombies that are in the setting.</li>
<li><strong>Lay on Hands:</strong> Healing and curing disease/poison. Bad fit, unfortunately.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Smite:</strong> Change the damage type (Probably Necrotic) and who you get extra damage against and it works out better.</li>
<li><strong>Spells</strong> The spell-list isn't perfect. It's got a lot of healing, white-mage-type-stuff. Could use an overhaul.</li>
<li><strong>Fighting Style</strong> Some of them work. Maybe changing up the list would be worthwhile.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Health</strong> Sure.</li>
<li><strong>Extra Attack</strong> Absolutely.</li>
<li><strong>Aura of Protection</strong> Sure.</li>
<li><strong>Aura of Courage</strong> Sure.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Divine Smite</strong> Sure, but change the damage type as per Divine Smite.</li>
<li><strong>Cleansing Touch</strong> The flavor doesn't fit super well. Would work better if you could end beneficial spells on enemies.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Oath of Conquest Paladin</strong> — One of the Better fits
<ul>
<li><strong>Oath:</strong> Not Terrible</li>
<li><strong>Oath Spells:</strong> All of these are a good fit thematically, though no Lifedrain or Manadrain.</li>
<li><strong>Conquering Strike:</strong> Awesome</li>
<li><strong>Guided Strike:</strong> Awesome</li>
<li><strong>Aura of Conquest:</strong> More Awesome</li>
<li><strong>Implacable Spirit:</strong> I like it.</li>
<li><strong>Invincible Conquerer:</strong> Sure why not</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Oath of Treachery Paladin</strong> — A mediocre fit with a couple iconic abilities.
<ul>
<li><strong>Oath:</strong> N/A</li>
<li><strong>Oath Spells:</strong> Not great.</li>
<li><strong>Conjure Duplicate:</strong> Eh</li>
<li><strong>Poison Strike:</strong> Sure</li>
<li><strong>Aura of Treachery:</strong> Sure</li>
<li><strong>Blackguard's Escape:</strong> 100%. This happens in the cutscenes all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Icon of Deceit:</strong> Sure</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Oath of Vengeance Paladin</strong> — A decent but imperfect fit.
<ul>
<li><strong>Oath:</strong> Eh. Too Vigilante.</li>
<li><strong>Oath Spells:</strong> These are a damn good fit, thematically. Still no Lifedrain or Manadrain though.</li>
<li><strong>Abjure Enemy:</strong> Fear + Slow</li>
<li><strong>Vow of Enmity:</strong> Sure, this fits.</li>
<li><strong>Relentless Avenger:</strong> This is neat</li>
<li><strong>Soul of Vengeance:</strong> Eh.</li>
<li><strong>Avenging Angel:</strong> Nope</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Oath of the Crown Paladin</strong> — A terrible fit.
<ul>
<li><strong>Oath:</strong> No, Not for Dark Knight.</li>
<li><strong>Oath Spells:</strong> No, not really.</li>
<li><strong>Champion Challenge:</strong> Not really.</li>
<li><strong>Turn the Tide:</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Allegiance:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Unyielding Spirit:</strong> Sure.</li>
<li><strong>Exalted Champion:</strong> Nope</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Oathbreaker Paladin</strong> — A Decent Fit
<ul>
<li><strong>Oath:</strong> N/A.</li>
<li><strong>Oath Spells:</strong> Sure, good fit.</li>
<li><strong>Control Undead:</strong> Yeah, thats cool.</li>
<li><strong>Dreadful Aspect:</strong> Not so much.</li>
<li><strong>Aura of Hate:</strong> This is good.</li>
<li><strong>Supernatural Resistance:</strong> Sure.</li>
<li><strong>Dread Lord:</strong> This is cool.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Roleplay: You're in it for yourself. Your superiors (assuming you have any) likely know it, but you get the job done, and you'll do things (with discretion) that many others wouldn't even consider.</p>

<p style="clear: both;">I hope you guys enjoyed reading this one, I know I enjoyed making it. It's flavorful and feels foul, tainted. A Paladin with an "evil" oath just doesn't fit the bill. Too much stuff that just doesn't fit the fluff.</p>

<p>So, life has gotten pretty nuts recently. As much as I'd love to continue to do 2 posts a week, it looks like I'm going to have to go down to one post a week for the next while. Expect a post next up for next Monday morning, when I'll be taking a look at how to build another Job in 5e.</p>
