<p>Welcome to Part 5 of Job Builds! This time I'm going to take a stab at the Dragonkin!</p>

<h1>Dragonkin</h1>

<p><strong>Premise</strong> — The Dragonkin/Dragoner is a Dragonblooded beastial gish, who has breath weapons and support spells, and a way with  (and the ability to talk to) animals. </p>
<p><strong>Core Gameplay Abilities</strong> — Elemental Breath Weapons, solid for martial combat, Healing, Status Effect Removal</p>
<p>Unlike the other Jobs I've built, I'm going to attempt this two different ways. One involves a PWYW DM's Guild Class, and the other is going to be tweaks on a PHB Class.</p>

<h2>Class/Subclass Options</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dmsguild.com/product/172957/DD-5e--Dragon-Shaman-Class">Dragonformer Dragon Shaman</a></strong> — [Pay What You Want] This one is a great fit for the FFT Dragonkin. The Spell list could use a bit of work, however. It lacks a Charm, Healing, Negative Status Removal, and Buff spell,s which (aside from breath weapons) are the bulk of what a Dragonkin has in FFT. But it does <strong>HAVE</strong> spellcasting.<p>

<p><strong>Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer</strong> — Well, this gives us the breath weapons and some dragon fluff, but it's a much more magic focused approach to be sure. Additionally, the sorcerer spell-list isn't any better a fit than the Dragon Shaman one, it's more or less missing the same key spells. But as it's a full spell list, rather than a very limited list, we're going to take a different tack than just adding all the iconic spells<p>

					The Dragonkin Sorcerer casts spells like a Sorcerer. However, The spells available do not come from the Sorcerer Spell List. Instead, the Dragonkin Sorcerer casts spells from the Druid Spell List.

<p>Either one of these gives a reasonable approximation of the FFT Dragonkin, depending on how martial-focused you're trying to go. Combining Sorcerer metamagics with the Druid list could also be interesting.</p>

<p style="clear: both;">That's it for today. This one was interesting (and not originally what I had planned on covering today, but I stumbled across Dragon Shaman while working on the Dragoon, got sidetracked working on this one, and I just had to go for it.)</p>
<p>See you next time;</p>
