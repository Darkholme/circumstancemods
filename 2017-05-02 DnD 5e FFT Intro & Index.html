<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>I don't represent Wizards of the Coast, who owns D&amp;D; nor do I represent Square-Enix, who owns the Final Fantasy franchise. From what I understand, everything in this series falls under fair use. To play D&D (even with the suggested modifications herein) you will need to have the D&D 5th Edition rules. You can buy those on Amazon, here <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606/ref=sr_1_2">Player's Handbook</a> and here <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Masters-Guide-Core-Rulebook/dp/0786965622/ref=sr_1_7">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. Final Fantasy doesn't have an official tabletop RPG, but you can easily buy Final Fantasy Tactics <a href="https://store.playstation.com/#!/cid=UP9000-NPUJ94221_00-0000000000000001">Playstation Classic [PS3, PSP, PS Vita]</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/#!/cid=UP0082-ULUS10297_00-FFTWOLUMDL000000">War of the Lions, [PSP/PS Vita]</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFT_en2">War of the Lions, [Android]</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/final-fantasy-tactics-the-war-of-the-lions/id446760220">War of the Lions, [iOS]</a>, or <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-Sony-PlayStation-1-1998-/132179117044?hash=item1ec67d43f4:g:6woAAOSw44BYltrA">Playstation Classic [PS1, PS2, PS3]</a> and experience the most enjoyable SRPG I've ever played, with an excellent story and world. (If you're wondering which I'd recommend picking up, it would be either the Classic one, because the game looks better in 4:3 than in stretched 16:9, or the PSP one, because the translation is worlds better, and there are voice acted cutscenes).</p>

<h1>Preamble</h1>
<p>In this series of articles, I'm going to be looking into how to Mechanically use D&D 5th edition to run a campaign set in the world of Final Fantasy Tactics</p>

<p>I won't be writing up a campaign setting for the world or anything like that (If you want one of those, you'll have to look at the Wiki), I'm only focusing on what to do to adapt the mechanics of D&D 5th Edition so that it can provide a reasonable mechanical facsimile of FFT's characters and world, usable if you want to run a FFT Tabletop RPG Campaign.</p>
