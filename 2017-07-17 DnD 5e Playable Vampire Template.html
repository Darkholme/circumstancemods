<p>So, I'm getting ready to run a new 5e Campaign (in Forgotten Realms) with my group, and two of the players asked me if they could play (and start) as classic Ravenloft-esque vampires, apparently because they're on a Castlevania kick. Being the accommodating  and homebrew-comfortable DM that I am, I said yes.</p>
<p>Looked around a bit, didn't like any of the options I was able to find. With a bit of reviewing and suggestions from a friend, and a lot of reviewing the sorts of abilities vampires have in both 5e and previous editions of the game, I came up with a template that I'm comfortable allowing the players to have. It feels very much like it fits the themes of a D&D vampire, without giving the characters abilities that are too powerful for any given character level. It was also important to me that it be a template rather than class levels, so if the character is killed and resurrected (whereby they would come back without vampirism) the character would not have to be rebuilt, simply remove the template. The worst logistical issue would arise from them (possibly) having to replace vampire specific feats they took, which is much simpler, and has a smaller impact if they have to finish a session without them.</p>
<p>The daylight and water weaknesses could be a very large hurdle, so much so that this will not be suitable to all campaigns. Primarily those where the characters spend a lot of time outdoors during the day. Another significant concern is the shortage of low level spells that can heal undead in 5e. In my particular case I'll be allowing coming up with some healing abilities to fill that gap. I have not determined what they will be yet, but I may allow a necrotic lay-on-hands from the vampire paladin, and I may also add in a new spell for clerics that heals undead but not the living.</p>

<h1>Vampire</h1>
<p>Any creature that is not an elemental, construct, or undead can become a vampire. When a creature becomes a vampire, it retains all statistics except as noted below.</p>
<h2>Vampire Traits</h2>
<p><strong>Undead Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead. Undead creatures don’t breathe, and don’t need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Darkvision:</strong> 60ft.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Vulnerability:</strong> Radiant, piercing damage from wooden weapons, slashing damage from silver weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Resistance:</strong> Necrotic; nonmagical bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong>Shadowless:</strong> A vampire casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Drain:</strong> A vampire can spend 1 minute sucking blood from a grappled, paralyzed, restrained, stunned, unconscious, or willing opponent, giving the victim one level of exhaustion. For each size category smaller that the victim is, increase the levels of exhaustion given by 1. For each size category larger than the vampire that the victim is, increase the number of times the Blood Drain action has to be used before the victim gets a level of exhaustion by 1 (larger creatures have more blood). For instance, a medium vampire trying to blood drain a gargantuan creature has to blood drain 4 times before the victim takes a level of exhaustion. When a vampire uses Blood Drain, it recovers a level of exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Create Spawn:</strong> A vampire can spend 30 seconds giving a dead creature vampirism. The target rises again as a vampire, at the next sundown. This does not work if the target’s body is destroyed by fire, if the target has been decapitated, or if the target has been dead for longer than 2 minutes before the vampire starts to Create Spawn.</p>
<p><strong>Hard to Kill:</strong> Vampires can only truly *die* a handful of ways: fire, sunlight, running water, decapitation, massive damage. When a vampire drops to 0hp, they do not make death saves (and can suffer neither death saving throw successes or failures), they stay inert unless something brings them back to 1hp, or kills them. When at or below 0hp, a vampire continues to accrue levels exhaustion from thirst.</p>
<p><strong>Torpor:</strong> A vampire who would die of exhaustion does not carry on to an afterlife. They remain trapped in their unmoving husk, trapped with no senses, with only their own thoughts to keep them company. A vampire in torpor can be resuscitated using a pint of fresh blood, which activates their regeneration ability. They come back with 4 levels of thirst exhaustion (an additional 4 pints will bring them back without any exhaustion). If they were in Torpor for more than a day, they come back with one indefinite madness trait. If they were in torpor for more than 7 days, they come back with two indefinite madness traits instead.</p>
<p><strong>Regeneration:</strong> As a bonus action, if it isn't in fire, sunlight, or running water, the vampire can choose to take a level of exhaustion (for thirst, if you’re tracking such things). If it does, for the next 5 rounds, it regains its level in hit points at the start of its turn. If the vampire takes radiant damage, fire damage, acid damage from running water, or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn. A vampire who is at 0hp and has fewer than 5 levels of exhaustion can activate this ability once per day, at dusk (after accumulating any applicable thirst exhaustion for the day). Once the vampire uses this ability, it can’t use it again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
<p><strong>Climb:</strong> A vampire climbs without it costing additional movement.</p>
<p><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> After reaching level 5, a vampire is treated as though it were permanently under the effects of a Spider-Climb spell.</p>

<h2>Vampiric Powers</h2>
<p>If a vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water, it can use the following abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Children of the Night:</strong> As an action, when indoors, a vampire can magically call swarms of bats or rats, or half as many swarms of centipedes or spiders. While outdoors, it can instead call wolves or giant wolf spiders (as appropriate to the environment). The number of creatures called is as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Level</th><th>Type</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Swarm (Bat, Rat)</td><td>1d4</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Swarm (Centipede, Spider)</td><td>1d2</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Wolves, Giant Wolf Spiders</td><td>2d4</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Swarm (Bat, Rat)</td><td>2d3</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Swarm (Centipede, Spider)</td><td>1d3</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Wolves, Giant Wolf Spiders</td><td>2d6</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Swarm (Bat, Rat)</td><td>2d4</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Swarm (Centipede, Spider)</td><td>1d4</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Wolves, Giant Wolf Spiders</td><td>3d6</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds. The vampire can direct them using verbally and somatically, as a bonus action. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until it dismisses them as a bonus action. Once the vampire uses this ability, it can’t use it again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
<p><strong>Charm:</strong> Starting at level 3, a vampire can target a humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see them as well, the target must succeed on a DC (8+Proficiency+CHA) Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s Blood Drain attack.</p>
<p>A target that succeeds its saving throw is immune to the vampire’s charm ability for 24 hours.
Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 8 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. Once the vampire uses this ability, it can’t use it again until it finishes a long rest.</p>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<p><strong>Diet Restriction:</strong> A vampire can only subsist on blood. For purposes of hunger and thirst, vampires are immune to hunger, but are twice as thirsty, and the only fluid that will nourish them is blood. For a vampire, thirst exhaustion is evaluated at dusk each day.</p>
<p><strong>Forbiddance:</strong> The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</p>
<p><strong>Harmed by Running Water:</strong> The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it starts its turn in running water. It takes 10 acid damage if it starts its turn in heavy rain, and it takes 5 acid damage if it starts its turn in light rain. If the creature had a swim speed before becoming a vampire, it does not have this weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Stake to the Heart:</strong> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated or unconscious, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Sunlight Hypersensitivity:</strong> The vampire takes 10 radiant damage (doubled for vulnerability) when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>

<p>So, I know that some people are very against players having templates, such as for a vampire, or lich, or what have you. In my experience it works out well so long as the template in question isn't adding large stacking bonuses to what the player already had. But at this point, this template looks like it should get the job done without breaking the game. I'll come back and update this after it's been at the table for a while, and detail how it worked out for us.</p>
